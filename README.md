# Sinopsis 
In a world of dark caves in the undersea, covered with explosive mines, cachalots challenge each other using sonar waves to find stars. The scene is all dark, the player must control the cachalot with keyboard/joystick directionals and emit a sonar wave that "enlights" the path. This feature can be used as a strategy to hide the cachalot path from other players and forces the player to explore the map. 

# Goal
Collect stars. The match ends when all starts are collected.

# Who wins?
Who collect more stars :P
